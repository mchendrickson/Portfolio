                Malicious players were exploiting tools like <span className="purple">Cheat Engine</span> to spam teleport
                requests and clutter livestreamers’ screens. To prevent this, I developed a multi‐layered solution:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li className="about-activity">
                    <VscDebugBreakpointLogUnverified/> <span className="purple">Action Lock:</span> Users can no longer click
                    the teleport button once a teleport is already in progress.
                </li>
                <li className="about-activity">
                    <VscDebugBreakpointLogUnverified/> <span className="purple">Client‐Side Rate Limiting:</span> Only a set
                    number of requests can be sent per second, even if the UI is bypassed.
                </li>
                <li className="about-activity">
                    <VscDebugBreakpointLogUnverified/> <span className="purple">Server‐Side Redundancy:</span> A second rate
                    limiter on the server provides an extra safeguard against spam.
                </li>
                <li className="about-activity">
                    <VscDebugBreakpointLogUnverified/> <span className="purple">Suspicious Activity Alerts:</span> Users who
                    hit these limits trigger automatic flags and detailed logs for moderation.
                </li>
                <li className="about-activity">
                    <VscDebugBreakpointLogUnverified/> <span className="purple">Privacy Settings:</span> A new option lets
                    players opt out of teleport requests from anyone who isn’t on their friends list.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p style={{textAlign: "left"}}>
                This comprehensive approach <span className="purple">eliminated the exploit</span> and safeguarded the game’s
                community from harassment.
